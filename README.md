# CooperLabwork
Scripts created while working for Dr. Elizabeth Cooper

The scripts in this folder were created as part of the project involving structural variant analysis of 10 de novo assembled bioenergy sorghum genomes. My focus was on identifying transposable element insertion-site polymorphisms (TIPs) in these genomes with respect to the reference sorghum genome BTx623 to see if the transposable elements (TEs) were impacting any genes by their insertions and if yes, what kind of genes were getting impacted.
